## Who I am

### Hello there! My name is Elissavet Triantafyllopoulou and I come from Greece.

> I've been in love with the Internet since 1999 and worked as a web developer and designer since 2003.

I am an End-to-End Web Developer and Designer, coding both back-end and front-end, specializing in web design and open-source development as well as digital promotion and website maintenance.

I am an avid doodler, a dreamer and an INFP among a gazillion other things.
